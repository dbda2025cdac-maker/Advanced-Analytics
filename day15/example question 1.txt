Coinsider 30 working days in a month for the following

A car maufacturer manufactures two cars A and B

There are one robot, two engineers, and one detailer at work

The detailer is going on a short holiday so he only has 21 working days available

The two cars need the following resource times:
    Robot time: Car A 3 days, Car B 4 days
    Engineer time: Car A 5 days, Car B 6 days
    Detialer time: Car A 1.5 days, Car B 3 days

Car A provides 30000 profit whilst Car b offers 45000 profit

Optimize the car production

Decision Variables:
x = Number of A cars to be produced
y = Number of B cars to be produced

Objective Function:
    Maximize Z = 30000 X + 45000y

Constraints
    Robot time(R) 3x + 4y <= R(Note r = 30)
    Engineer time(E) 5x + 6y <= 2E(Note E = 30)
    Detailer time(T) 1.5x + 3y <= 21
    Non negative x>=0 , y>=0

Problem
    Find Maximize Z
