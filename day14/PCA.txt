PCA (PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS)

FEATURES X Variable : age pedegree ,bmi, bp, ht,wt,preg, skin 
label Y predictions : diabetes (yes/no)

supppose we built a NB / DT / LR classification model => accuracy 90%

PCA:Can we reduce some features from X without loosing the prediction ability too much

Find columns that are similar and 'combines' them mathematically
exp: First Principal Component (PC1):65% contribution from glucose column , 25% contribution from age column
10% from bmi, 

if we only retain the PC1 value then we will get almost 40% accuracy

PC2 => 67% 

generally we stop at 90 - 95%  (industry standards)
